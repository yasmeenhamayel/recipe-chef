Smart Chef Chatbot 

This is my first Python project! I built this AI-powered chatbot to help people find recipes easily based on what ingredients they have at home.

# Personal Milestone
I built this project from scratch as part of my *self-learning journey*. I taught myself:
- How to code in *Python*.
- How to manage data using *Pandas*.
- How to create a web interface using *Streamlit*.
- How to deploy a live app via *GitHub*.

#How it works
1. *Input:* You tell the chef what ingredients you have (in Arabic or English).
2. *Filters:* You can tell the chef if you have any allergies or ingredients you dislike.
3. *Results:* The app searches through `recipes.csv` and suggests the top 3 matching meals.

# Built with
- Python 3
- Streamlit (For the UI)
- Pandas (For data)
- Deep Translator (To support Arabic)
